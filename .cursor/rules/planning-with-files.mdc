# Planning with Files

Use persistent markdown files as "working memory on disk" for complex tasks.

## Core Principle

```
Context Window = RAM (volatile, limited)
Filesystem = Disk (persistent, unlimited)
→ Anything important gets written to disk.
```

## When to Use This Pattern

**Use for:**
- Multi-step tasks (3+ steps)
- Research tasks
- Building/creating features
- Tasks spanning many tool calls
- Refactoring across multiple files

**Skip for:**
- Simple questions
- Single-file edits
- Quick lookups

## The 3-File Pattern

For complex tasks, create these files in the project root:

| File | Purpose | When to Update |
|------|---------|----------------|
| `task_plan.md` | Phases, progress, decisions, errors | After each phase |
| `findings.md` | Research, discoveries, requirements | After ANY discovery |
| `progress.md` | Session log, test results | Throughout session |

## Critical Rules

### 1. Create Plan First
Never start a complex task without `task_plan.md`. This is non-negotiable.

### 2. The 2-Action Rule
After every 2 view/browser/search operations, IMMEDIATELY save key findings to `findings.md`.
This prevents visual/multimodal information from being lost.

### 3. Read Before Decide
Before major decisions (architecture, approach changes), re-read `task_plan.md` to keep goals in focus.

### 4. Update After Act
After completing any phase:
- Mark phase status: `pending` → `in_progress` → `complete`
- Log any errors encountered
- Note files created/modified

### 5. Log ALL Errors
Every error goes in the plan file with attempt number and resolution:

```markdown
## Errors Encountered
| Error | Attempt | Resolution |
|-------|---------|------------|
| TypeError: x is undefined | 1 | Added null check |
| Build failed | 2 | Fixed import path |
```

### 6. Never Repeat Failures
```
if action_failed:
    next_action != same_action
```
Track what you tried. Mutate the approach.

## The 3-Strike Error Protocol

```
ATTEMPT 1: Diagnose & Fix
  → Read error carefully
  → Identify root cause
  → Apply targeted fix

ATTEMPT 2: Alternative Approach
  → Same error? Try different method
  → Different tool? Different library?
  → NEVER repeat exact same failing action

ATTEMPT 3: Broader Rethink
  → Question assumptions
  → Search for solutions
  → Consider updating the plan

AFTER 3 FAILURES: Escalate to User
  → Explain what you tried
  → Share the specific error
  → Ask for guidance
```

## Read vs Write Decision Matrix

| Situation | Action | Reason |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Just wrote a file | DON'T read it back | Content still in context |
| Viewed image/PDF | Write findings NOW | Multimodal → text before lost |
| Browser returned data | Write to file | Screenshots don't persist |
| Starting new phase | Read plan/findings | Re-orient if context stale |
| Error occurred | Read relevant file | Need current state to fix |
| Resuming after gap | Read all planning files | Recover state |

## The 5-Question Reboot Test

If you can answer these, context is solid:

| Question | Answer Source |
|----------|---------------|
| Where am I? | Current phase in task_plan.md |
| Where am I going? | Remaining phases |
| What's the goal? | Goal statement in plan |
| What have I learned? | findings.md |
| What have I done? | progress.md |

## Anti-Patterns

| Don't | Do Instead |
|-------|------------|
| State goals once and forget | Re-read plan before decisions |
| Hide errors and retry silently | Log errors to plan file |
| Stuff everything in context | Store large content in files |
| Start executing immediately | Create plan file FIRST |
| Repeat failed actions | Track attempts, mutate approach |

## Task Plan Template

```markdown
# Task Plan: [Brief Description]

## Goal
[One sentence describing the end state]

## Current Phase
Phase 1

## Phases

### Phase 1: Requirements & Discovery
- [ ] Understand user intent
- [ ] Identify constraints
- [ ] Document findings
- **Status:** in_progress

### Phase 2: Planning & Structure
- [ ] Define technical approach
- [ ] Create structure if needed
- **Status:** pending

### Phase 3: Implementation
- [ ] Execute step by step
- [ ] Test incrementally
- **Status:** pending

### Phase 4: Testing & Verification
- [ ] Verify requirements met
- [ ] Document test results
- **Status:** pending

### Phase 5: Delivery
- [ ] Review output
- [ ] Deliver to user
- **Status:** pending

## Decisions Made
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|

## Errors Encountered
| Error | Attempt | Resolution |
|-------|---------|------------|
```

## Reminder

Since Cursor doesn't have automatic hooks:
- The user may need to remind you to create/update planning files
- Proactively suggest creating planning files for complex tasks
- Periodically re-read `task_plan.md` during long tasks
